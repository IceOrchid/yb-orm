0.2.4
    Add SqlPool for database connection pooling, thanx to Nikita Buyvich.
    ResultSet is now able to cache all rows, i.e. not necessary lazy.
    Support for two or more distinct relations on the same
    table using different foreign keys.
    Add support for 32bit integer SQL data type in schema.
    Build script for cmake and mingw.
    Support for Postgres dialect.
    Auth example: Allow to register the first user via link like this:
    http://localhost:9090/registration?login=medved&pass=preved&name=Medved&status=0
    Bugs fixed:
    Fix a long lasted bug with misuse of ODBC function SQLBindParameter.

0.2.3
    Simple logger implementation.
    Reimplemented xml Writer classes from scratch (not using libxml2).
    Replaced Xml::Node with more convenient class ElementTree::Element,
    still depending on libxml2, but not exposing any of its internals.
    Auth is a separate demo project contributed by Nikita Buyvich,
    the project is a minimal HTTP server, which implements a toy auth
    ptotocol using XML.  Look in examples/auth.
    Many bugfixes.

0.2.2
    Build in schema pieces into generated classes.
    Update of autogenerated code now works (AUTOGEN sections only).
    Keep smart pointers to Tables and Relations.
    Automatic registration of domain classes at DomainFactory singleton.
    Wide Unicode partial support.
    Start to work on a tutorial.
    Bugs fixed:
    TestDataObject::test_data_object_relink()
    TestDataObjectSaveLoad::test_flush_new_linked_to_existing()
    TestDataObjectSaveLoad::test_lazy_load_fail()

0.2.1
    Row becomes a vector of named values.
    Diffenetiate save() and save_or_update().
    Implement load_collection() using DataObjectResultSet with iterator.
    Three levels of lazy result sets: SqlResultSet, DataObjectResultSet and
    DomainObjectResultSet template class.

0.2.0
    The Big Change: new internal weak-typed row representation DataObject class
    replaces old RowData class.  Session class has been also rewritten from
    scratch.
    This solves old big problems with how object relations are represented and
    who shall be responsible for holding object reference.
    Now deletion (including cascading) works for objects and relations.

0.1.2
    Document XML metadata format, add 'relation' element for relations
        between classes.
    Initial support for backrefs via managed lists, to make one-to-many
        relationships more usable.
