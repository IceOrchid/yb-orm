# Near future plans

These features should be implemented in next release or two. Some kind of road
map:

* Construct `SqlConnection` from raw connection handle. 

* Support for BLOB data type. 

* `yborm_gen`: it should be possible to specify the types of columns explicitly. 

* `yborm_gen`: basic database schema reverse engineering. 

* Try code generation with macros. 

* `QueryObj`: optional explicit `.select_from()` clause. 

* `QueryObj`: explicit `.join()` clause in Query object. 

* `SqlConnection`: information about character encoding, support automatic encoding conversions. 

# Wish list

These things will be implemented one day. Need to keep in mind:

* Relationships: implement inheritance, at least three models are possible. 

* Relationships: implement n-to-n relationship using link table, represent it as collection properties. 

* Improve query language, allow for intermixing domain classes and column expressions in `query<>()`. 

* Optional caching of result sets. 

* Library API in common: more possibilities for customization. 

* Comment the source code! Use Doxygen for API docs. 

* What about C++11? 

* and more ...
