Some things to keep in mind:
    - keep it simple
    - low dependencies
    - keep test coverage

To be implemented:
    - nice tutorial and samples
    - better relationship handling (many-to-many, inheritance)
    - SQL constructor language (low level)
    - convenient object-based query language (high level)
    - more specialized SQL backends instead of ODBC

Mostly done:
    - proper object deletion
    - relationship handling (one-to-many)

Done:
    - connection pooling
    - update auto-generated C++ code, separate somehow the autogenerated code
        to allow for adding user code to the classes
    - retrieving data using kinda resultset iterator
    - wide unicode strings
