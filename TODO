Here are some things to keep in mind:

    - better relationships handling
        one-to-many (partially implemented)
        many-to-many, inheritance
    - proper object deletion
    - update auto-generated C++ code, separate somehow the autogenerated code
        to allow for adding user code to the classes
    - retrieving data using kinda resultset iterator
    - object-based query language
    - connection pooling
    - wide unicode strings
    - more specialized SQL backends instead of ODBC
