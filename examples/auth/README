ABOUT

Auth is a separate demo project contributed by Nikita Buyvich.
It demonstrates some of YB.ORM use cases.
You need YB.ORM installed in order to build Auth.

The project consists of single executable, which runs a minimal
HTTP server at port 9090.  The server processes GET/POST queries
of several types: /login, /logout, /session_info, /check, and
/registration.
After a successful call to /login you will get an XML response
with session token, that may be passed to all other calls.
To perform initial login you will need to insert first user into
your T_USERS table.  Note that PASS field must contain MD5(password)
for that user.

BUILD

To build Auth under Unix, please use autogen.sh/configure scripts.
On Windows you should use cmake system, in this case it is assumed
that YB.ORM resides in c:\yborm folder.

For instance, you can build and install YB.ORM locally as follows:
sh autogen.sh
./configure --with-test-dbtype=MYSQL --with-test-db=test1_db \
  --with-test-user=test1 --with-test-passwd=test1_pwd --disable-static \
  --prefix=/home/vaclav/inst1
make check && make install

Then you can build Auth itself, like this:
sh autogen.sh
./configure --with-test-dbtype=MYSQL --with-test-db=test1_db \
  --with-test-user=test1 --with-test-passwd=test1_pwd --disable-static \
  --prefix=/home/vaclav/inst1 \
  --with-yborm-includes=/home/vaclav/inst1/include/yb \
  --with-yborm-libs=/home/vaclav/inst1/lib \
  --with-yborm-bin=/home/vaclav/inst1/bin
make
